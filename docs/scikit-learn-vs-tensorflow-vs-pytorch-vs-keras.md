# Scikit-Learn vs. TensorFlow vs. PyTorch vs. Keras

## Scikit-Learn vs. TensorFlow

Scikit-Learn is a general machine learning library for Python. Users may find it has a lower barrier to entry as it is built on top of and integrates with commonly used libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and pandas.
On the other hand, TensorFlow, whilst also an open-source machine learning library, specializes on deep learning and neural networks with support for several programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Java, Javascript, etc.

Consider Scikit-Learn if you are new to machine learning and/or are developing something using non-neaural network algorithms.

Consider TensorFlow if you want to use a deep learning approach in conjunction with hardware acceleration through GPUs, TPUs or a cluster of computers which Scikit-Learn does not natively support.

## PyTorch vs. Scikit-Learn

PyTorch is a deep learning software library for Python, C++ and Julia. PyTorch is primarily used for end-to-end building and training of deep neural networks with the ability to create custom models and learning algorithms.
Scikit-Learn is a library for traditional machine learning algorithms used for clustering, classification, regression, etc. Scikit-Learn's black-box nature makes it more accessible to those who are realively new to machine learning.

Consider PyTorch if you're developing applications that have computationally expensive tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision, etc. With Pytorch, you are also able to utilize GPU acceleration to your advantage.

Consider Scikit-Learn if you're developing a small exploratory project that doesn't require a substantial amount of data. With Scikit-Learn your focus would not be on customisation but rather on the speed and user-friendliness of the machine learning algorithms.

## Keras vs. Scikit-Learn

Keras is a high-level deep learning framework, that abstracts many of the low-level details and computations away by handing them off to TensorFlow. This allows Keras to have reduced code complexity despite being a deep learning framework.
Scikit-Learn has an even greater level of abstraction for common machine learning algortihms. Scikit-Learn does not have native support for GPU computing and deep learning.

Consider Keras if your application/model has to use neural networks to learn from large amounts of data. Keras also caters for those who are fairly new to deep learning.

Consider Scikit-Learn if you require a model for statistical purposes, predictions, classification, clustering, etc. Scikit-Learn works well with relatively small datasets which require general machine learning computations.

## PyTorch vs. TensorFlow

PyTorch is a relatively younger deep learning framework with a pythonic and object oriented approach. PyTorch allows for comparatively superior debugging with more choices.
TensorFlow, similarly, is a low-level deep learning library. TensorFlow has been around for longer and also provides high-level APIs such as Keras - albeit with less computational power. TensorFlow currently has broader adoption and a superior visualization tool - TensorBoard (PyTorch also integrates with TensorBoard).

Consider PyTorch if Python is central to your development. PyTorch currently has more straightened debugging capabilities.

Consider TensorFlow if you want a library compatible with various coding languages such as C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, etc. TensorFlow also has extensive multi-platform support.

## Keras vs. TensorFlow

Keras acts as a deep learning-centric library running on top of TensorFlow. This abstraction allows Keras to be better suited for developers to build, train, and evaluate models with relatice 'ease'. Keras supports Python and R while Tensorflow supports the major - Python, C++, Java, and Javascript - languages with Go and Swift being unofficial and archived respectively.
TensorFlow runs as a back-end to Keras, but also as it's own standalone library for low level computations.

Consider Keras if you are relatively new to deep learning or looking to use a high level api utilizing the TensorFlow framework to your advantage. As with any library, Keras takes into account best practices with comparatively less complexity.

Consider TensorFlow if you require greater funtionality and performance on large datasets.
TensorFlow requires you to be slightly adept with deep learning to capitalize on what it has to offer.

## Keras vs. PyTorch

Keras is a software library focused on deep learning. Keras functions as a high-level interface for the TensorFlow library, resulting in comparatively slower computations, but less complexity.
PyTorch is a low-level computation framework with superior debugging, pliability and performance capabilities.

Consider Keras if want to use deep learning algorithms and models with relatively small datasets. Keras is more readable and approachable to beginners.

Consider PyTorch if you have deep learning experience and/or want to create a custom model. Keep in mind that, natively, PyTorch is not capable of running on a browser (It is currently possible using through a conversion process that converts PyTorch to TensorFlow.js).
