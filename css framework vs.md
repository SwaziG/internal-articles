## Bootstrap vs. Tailwind CSS

For good reason, *Bootstrap* is the most popular CSS framework in this comparison. With many years and versions behind bootstrap, it is a trusted go-to framework that has kept itself up to date.

*Tailwind CSS* is a relatively newer framework and way of styling HTML that challenges established conventions.

Consider *Bootstrap* if you prefer an established design system that comes with predefined design choices.

Consider *Tailwind CSS* if you are welcoming of using a newer rapid approach that essentially populates your markup in an effort to create custom UI components.  

## Material UI vs. Tailwind CSS
*Material UI* is a React components library based on Google's Material design.

On the other hand, *Tailwind CSS* is a CSS framework that comes with predefined classes (not components) as building blocks to design any UI.

Consider *Material UI* if you are an avid React user and do not have the time to build a custom UI from scratch.

Consider *Tailwind CSS* if you want to build a custom UI within your markup whilst writing almost no custom css. 

## Styled Components vs. Tailwind CSS
*Styled Components* is a React CSS-in-JavaScript framework you can use to write custom css using JavaScript. 

*Tailwind CSS* allows you to build UIs using multiple abbreviated class names as opposed to semantic classes.   

Consider *Styled Components* if you're looking to create custom React components whilst staying within the React ecosystem. 

Consider *Tailwind CSS* if you have no experience with JavaScript/React but still looking to create reusable custom components.

## Bulma  vs. Tailwind CSS
Although *Bulma* is a mobile-first CSS framework similar to Bootstrap, it is lightweight with a limited number of components and JavaScript exclusion.

*Tailwind CSS* employs a different methodology that places best-practices on the back-burner in favour of flexible UI designing.

Consider *Bulma* if you want to build responsive sites with a gentle learning curve.

Consider *Tailwind CSS* for an un-opinionated approach to design using a fairly new framework and method.

## Sass vs. Tailwind CSS
*Sass* generates CSS for you using it's own scripted language. Sass aims at being a concise way of writing CSS. 

With *Tailwind* you are not likely to write any CSS and but rather abbreviated classes such as `flex`, `m-4` and `bg-red-100` etc. on your markup file.

Consider *Sass* if you would like to write much of the CSS yourself only with a more stable syntax.
 
Consider *Tailwind CSS* if you want to quickly create designs using micro classes that would all be contained within your markup. Keep in mind this may be unreadable for non-Tailwind users.

## Bootstrap vs. Material UI
*Bootstrap* is a beginner friendly framework that comes with pre-packaged UI components and JavaScript plugins that will do most of the heavy lifting when designing and building a website. 

*Material UI* also offers reusable pre-designed components and layouts, however, they are based on Google's Material design.

Consider *Bootstrap* if you want to keep complexity low and still have a large number of options to pick from.

Consider *Material UI* if you can use React and want a more stable implementation of a design system within React.

## Sass vs. Styled Components
*Sass*, as a scripting language compiles into plain css which makes it debugging friendly.  

*Styled components* allows for creating customized and reusable components, but with the drawback of comparatively difficult debugging due to writing CSS in JavaScript. Styled components does have Sass support as well.

Consider *Sass* if you essentially *do not* want to lock yourself into a specialized workflow with a steeper learning curve.
Consider *Styled Components* if you want to have significantly less chances of overriding styling as styles are not globally scoped.

## Material UI vs. Styled Components
*Material UI* is a CCS-in-JS framework that provides ready-to-use components, themes and user interfaces.

*Styled Components* whilst similar to Material UI, gives you the ability to build custom CSS components.

Consider *Material UI* if you want to significantly cut production time down by using a UI library with consistent designs and a vast community behind it.

Consider *Styled Components* for a more hands on approach to creating custom UIs.

## Bootstrap vs. Bulma 
Bootstrap is a framework that has been around for far longer and so has built up an extensive set of design choices and community.

*Bulma* can be seen as a smaller version of bootstrap with less complexities, providing beginners with comparable benefits to it's much larger -bootstrap- counterpart. 

Consider *Bootstrap* if you're looking to step up to a much larger design palette using an up-to-date framework built on Sass. Keep in mind that bootstrap can sometimes be overly complex and encumbered leading to a bulky app/website.

Consider *Bulma* if you would much rather do without the complexities of bootstrap(i.e. javascript) whilst having some of the component creation taken care of by a tiny, non-intrusive framework.

## Bulma  vs. Material UI
*Bulma* is mobile-first CSS framework aimed at more simple-usage scenarios. It is pre-packaged a number of ready-to-use components.

*Material UI* Makes use of a pre-defined Material design system for use in React. Besides basic components, Material UI also comes with UI elements like sliders, drop downs, navigation bars, etc.

Consider *Bulma* If you to simply build a usable website with less time and complications. 

Consider *Material UI* if you want a robust, well-documented design system to use in your React app.

## Bootstrap vs. Sass
*Bootstrap*, now built on Sass is a collection of pre designed UI components and best practices.

*Sass* is a scripting language that provides a clearer, concise approach to writing custom css.

Consider *Bootstrap* if you don't want to build a custom design from scratch, or just simply learn a popular CSS framework.

Consider *Sass* if you want to  write custom CSS with scripting benefits and tools such as nesting, mixins, and inheritance, whilst keeping your CSS fairly maintainable.
